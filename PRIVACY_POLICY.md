# Privacy Policy for JSON Viewer Pro

**Last updated:** 2026-02-24

## Overview

JSON Viewer Pro is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains what data the extension accesses, how it's used, and how it's stored.

## Data Collection

JSON Viewer Pro does **not** collect, transmit, or share any personal data.

### What the extension accesses:
- **Page content** (only on pages that contain raw JSON): Used solely to detect and format JSON responses. Page content is processed locally in your browser and is never sent to any server.
- **Extension settings**: Your preferences (enabled/disabled, theme choice) are stored locally using Chrome's built-in storage API (chrome.storage.sync). If you're signed into Chrome, these settings may sync across your devices through your Google account — this is standard Chrome behavior and is not controlled by us.

### What the extension does NOT do:
- Does not collect analytics or usage data
- Does not use cookies or tracking pixels
- Does not transmit any data to external servers
- Does not access your browsing history
- Does not inject ads, donation popups, or promotional content
- Does not modify pages that are not JSON responses

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. No data is stored on external servers.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the updated policy will be posted here and the "last updated" date will be revised. Significant changes will be noted in the extension's changelog.
